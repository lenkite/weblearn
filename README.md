### TODO

- [ ] Figure how to custom code the material SWITCH TOGGLE using plain CSS. See `toggle__thumb` in  `web.dev.css`
  and [extrinsic vs intrinsic sizing](./cssbasics/1b_extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-sizing.html)
- [ ] Interestingly the TOGGLE SWITCH and other tutorials are all taken from: https://piccalil.li/tutorials/. Find the
  simplest CSS switch by trying out various strategies.
- [ ] Analyze the box model codepen example after studying gradients and
  box-shadows: https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/BaReoEV
- [x] The stack layout:
